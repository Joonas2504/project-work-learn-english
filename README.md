# Learn English App
This project is a full-stack web application designed to help users learn and practice English vocabulary. It incorporates a front-end built with React, a back-end powered by Node.js and Express, and a MySQL database for storing word pairs. The application provides features such as adding, updating, and deleting word pairs, fetching word pairs by ID, and displaying all word pairs in a responsive table. The admin view allows users to manage the vocabulary, while the login functionality ensures secure access. The project also utilizes Docker for containerization, making it easy to deploy across different environments.
